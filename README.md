## Description
This project is about code refactoring. This means that I have to restructure the coding without affecting the original intended functions of the code. In this challenge, I am to assume the role of a junior developer to refactor the code of a marketing agency to make it more accessible. 

Accessibility is an important aspect of web development because not only it improves SEO - search engine optimization - rankings, but also, accomodates to people with disability. Websites with good SEO are likely to place higher in search engines, such as google. 

The major code refactor that I did are as follows:
* Organizing html to follow the semantic structure: I updated index.html to reflect the current html industry standard. I replaced `div` with `sections`. I added `main`, `figure`, `footer` and organize `h` headers. I also organize html to make it more clean looking. I also fix links and made sure all of them are working. 
* Consolidate most of the codes in CSS to avoid confusion and repetition. Reorganize it in proper order. Add comments to make it easier for the viewer to make changes later on, if necessary. 
* Optimize images for load speed which is a good practice for SEO. 
* Some additional things I added to improve the website are favicon and hover effect on links.
